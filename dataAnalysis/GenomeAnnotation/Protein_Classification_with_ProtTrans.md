# A ProtTrans pipeline to differentiate transmembrane domains containing proteins from others
### Introduction to ProtTrans for Bioinformatics Applications

ProtTrans is a powerful tool that combines cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) with protein sequence analysis. ProtTrans enables bioinformaticians to analyze and predict protein functions, structures, and classifications in ways that were previously unattainable. Whether you're working with kinases, functional domains, or even evolutionary questions, ProtTrans opens up new possibilities.

### What is ProtTrans?

ProtTrans is a transformer-based deep learning model designed to analyze protein sequences. It’s inspired by natural language processing (NLP) tools like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and adapts them for biological sequences. The model is trained on massive datasets of protein sequences from databases like UniProt, learning patterns, relationships, and evolutionary signals encoded in the amino acid sequences. These learned patterns are used to generate embeddings—numerical representations of proteins that capture their functional and structural properties.

### How ProtTrans Works and Where AI Fits in

**Deep Learning for Embeddings**
*  ProtTrans uses transformers, a type of deep learning AI, to generate protein embeddings.
    *  This step is analogous to converting raw text into dense numerical representations in NLP. Here, proteins are the "text," and the embeddings capture biochemical and functional properties.
*  Machine Learning for Downstream Tasks:
    *  After generating embeddings, you can feed them into traditional machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, random forests, or neural networks for classification, clustering, or prediction tasks.
    *  Example: Classifying proteins as transmembrane or non-transmembrane using a supervised model.
*  Data Preprocessing:
    *  AI-based preprocessing, like scaling and dimensionality reduction, ensures the embeddings are suitable for downstream machine learning models.

Each step combines insights from AI with domain knowledge, enabling you to tackle complex biological questions effectively.

### Applications of ProtTrans

*  ProtTrans has a wide range of applications in bioinformatics, including but not limited to:

    *  Protein Function Prediction:
        *  Determine the function of uncharacterized proteins by analyzing their sequence embeddings.

    *  Protein Classification:
        *  Classify proteins into functional categories, such as kinases, receptors, or transporters.

    *  Protein Structure and Folding:
        *  Leverage embeddings to predict structural features like secondary structure or intrinsic disorder.

    *  Variant Effect Prediction:
        *  Study the effects of mutations by comparing embeddings of wild-type and mutant sequences.

    *  Drug Discovery and Target Identification:
        *  Identify potential therapeutic targets by analyzing protein families, domains, or functional sites.

    *  Comparative Genomics:
        *  Use embeddings for clustering and similarity analysis across species to study protein evolution and conservation.

    *  Pathway Analysis:
        *  Annotate proteins involved in specific biochemical pathways by integrating ProtTrans outputs with pathway databases.

### Why Use ProtTrans

*  Scalability:
    *  Analyze thousands to millions of sequences efficiently.

*  Flexibility:
    *  Apply embeddings to diverse machine learning workflows for predictions, clustering, or annotations.

*  State-of-the-Art AI:
    *  ProtTrans leverages deep learning, ensuring high accuracy and biological relevance.

*  Biological Insights:
    *  Embeddings capture complex relationships in protein sequences that go beyond traditional sequence alignment methods.


### Learning Goals

*  Understand how ProtTrans uses AI to generate protein embeddings.
*  Learn how to integrate these embeddings into machine learning workflows for specific biological questions.
*  Gain insights into the versatility of ProtTrans for bioinformatics research.


### Installation of ProtTrans
```
#create a python virtual environment
python3 -m venv ProtTrans_pyenv
#activate the environment
source ProtTrans_pyenv/bin/activate


#install these three packages
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -q transformers
pip install torch
pip install sentencepiece
pip install protobuf
pip install h5py
pip install pandas
pip install sklearn
pip install scikit-learn
```

### Create a dataset for training

Here I just went to Uniprot.org to find proteins that were representative transmembrane domain containing proteins from UniRef (manually reviewed). Since we have been working with Arabidopsis, I have kept with that lineage by extracting only proteins from the Brassicaceae. To avoid biasing the model, we want to keep both protein types at an equal representation. 


### Transmembrane dataset
```

# number of proteins in each file. 
grep -c ">" *ransmembrane*.fasta
NotTransmembrane3700.fasta:64601
Transmembrane3700.fasta:18383

#The transmembrane dataset had proteins without transmembrane domains.  The nontransmembrane dataset had proteins with transmembrane domains. 

awk '{print $1}' ../NotTransmembrane3700.fasta >CleanTransmembrane3700.fasta
awk '{print $1}' ../NotTransmembrane3700.fasta >CleanNonTransmembrane3700.fasta
echo "tmhmm CleanNonTransmembrane3700.fasta" >NotTM.sh
echo "tmhmm CleanTransmembrane3700.fasta" >>NotTM.sh

grep "Number of predicted TMHs" CleanNonTransmembrane3700.tmhmmout |awk '$7==0 {print $2}' |cdbyank CleanNonTransmembrane3700.fasta.cidx |awk '{print $1}' >ActualTransmembraneNegative.fasta

grep "Number of predicted TMHs" CleanTransmembrane3700.tmhmmout |awk '$7!=0 {print $2}' |cdbyank CleanTransmembrane3700.fasta.cidx |awk '{print $1}' >ActualTransmembranePositive.fasta


# the distribution of proteins from each class for training
grep -c ">" *fasta
ActualTransmembraneNegative.fasta:14997
ActualTransmembranePositive.fasta:15352

cat ActualTransmembranePositive.fasta ActualTransmembraneNegative.fasta >TMProteinDataset.fasta 
```

                #protein sequence is tokenized into input features suitable for the transformer model. return_tensors="pt" converts the input into a PyTorch tensor, the format required.
                inputs = tokenizer(sequence, return_tensors="pt")
                #This prevents computation of gradients, processes tokens and outputs hidden states for each amino acid. 
                with torch.no_grad():
                    #last_hidden_state extracts the output of the last layer in the transformer, which contains the learned representation fo reach token. mean averages the token embeddings along the sequence length dimension. squeeze().numpy() converts the pytorch tensor into a numpy array. Averaging across the entire sequence condenses the data into a single vector representing each whole protein.
                    embedding = model(**inputs).last_hidden_state.mean(1).squeeze().numpy()
                #Protein ID is key, and computed embedding (numerical vector) is the value.

    # Save embeddings to file
    with open(output_pkl, "wb") as f:

```

**Run the embedding script**

Embed the fasta files of the transmembrane domain containing proteins and transmembrane-less proteins. This is the most time consuming step of the pipeline, and can take >24 hours for 100k proteins. 
```
python generate_embeddings.py --input TMProteinDataset.fasta --output TMembeddings.pkl   
```

Embed the fasta files of your unknown set of fasta sequences you plan to screen for transmembrane domains. 
```
python generate_embeddings.py --input SignalPDataset.fasta --output SignalPDataset.pkl
```

In your stdout you should have this output from the small model. The classification report provides metrics on: <br>
*  Precision: Fraction of positive predictions that are correct.
*  Recall: Fraction of true positives that are correctly predicted.
*  F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
*  Support: Number of actual occurrences of each class. <br>
The zero and 1 in our table represent our classes (non-transmembrane 0) and (transmembrane 1). Ideally we would have high scores for all classes. Coefficients that are further away from zero are better, and you'd like to have a higher number for Mean and Variance. At the bottom is the 20% training data that we split being tested. 31 tramsmembrane domain containing proteins accurately identified and 3042 transmembrane containing proteins incorrectly classified, 41 nontransmembrane domain containing proteins were correct and 2956 were not correct.

for prot_id, prob in zip(embeddings.keys(), y_pred_probs[:, 1]):
    # Classify based on the probability threshold
    pred = "transmembrane" if prob > 0.43 else "non-transmembrane"
    predictions[prot_id] = (pred, prob)

```

**Run the prediction**
```
python ../predict_transmembranes.py --embeddings SignalPDataset.pkl --model logistic_regression_model.pkl --output predictions.tsv
```
# Evaluate your Results
Based upon the threshold you set in your predict_transmembranes.py script, (0.43) in this case, you can determine if the protein was called a transmembrane-containing protein or non-transmembrane . This setting is directly proportional to the probability output in the third column of predictions.tsv.



SignalPDataset.fasta has 1000 proteins, 200 of which have a transmembrane domain.
