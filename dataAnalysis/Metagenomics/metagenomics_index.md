# Metagenomics Introduction

MetaGenomics is the study of genetics from the material directly obtained from environmental samples without the use of cultivation-based methods. Shotgun metagenomics is an approach based on randomly breaking down a long sequence of DNA fragment, use sequencing methods ( such as sanger or NGS) to sequence each fragment (contigs), and use algoritms to overlap the fragments to get the complete range of sequence.
