# Macbook Pro Installation


## Optional programs
* Microsoft Office Suite (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Teams, OneNote)
* Password Manager (Dashlane, OnePass, etc)


## Install Xcode Developer tools

In order to get the most out of your macbook, this developer's toolkit is required.  It is used to gain access to full functionality of github and R.  If you don't install this first, then you will later on as you install R and want to use github.

* The download takes a long time
* The unzipping takes a long time
* Move the Xcode App to your applications

## Install R

Install R from the package from R cran site.

* [Install R](https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN/)

    * https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN/bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64/base/R-4.1.2-arm64.pkg

I got the following error when I tried to install from DMG so don't do that.
**Error** "R can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software"
